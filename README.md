Action to sync GitHub labels in the declarative way.  
By using this action, you can sync current labels with labels configured in a YAML manifest.

## Usage

### Create YAML manifest of GitHub labels

```yaml
- color: d73a4a
  description: Something isn't working
  name: bug
- color: 0075ca
  description: Improvements or additions to documentation
  name: documentation
- color: cfd3d7
  description: This issue or pull request already exists
  name: duplicate
```

The default file path is `.github/labels.yml`, but you can specify any file path with `jobs.<job_id>.steps.with`.  
To create manifest of the current labels easily, we recommend using [label-exporter](https://github.com/micnncim/label-exporter).

### Create Workflow

```yaml
name: Sync labels in the declarative way
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@1.0.0
      - uses: micnncim/action-label-syncer@latest
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          GITHUB_REPOSITORY: ${{ github.repository }}
        with:
          manifest: labels.yml # default: .github/labels.yml
```
